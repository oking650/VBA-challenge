# VBA-challenge

Provided are the associated files with my TickerTracker Code. There are two iterations of VBA script -- there should be more, but I didn't commit all changes into the repository when I should have. There is one iteration from October 25th, using the Alphabetical_testing worksheet, and another file from Today, October 30th using the historical stock data.

Within VBA, I also include cell formatting based on the Metric. Percentages are now a percentage, Volume includes comma thousand separators, etc. 

Also included are three screenshots of the succesful Excel Output.
